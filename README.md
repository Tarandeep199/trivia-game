# trivia-game
This is a simple fun little python based trivia game with a sneaker trivia theme to it. 
It makes use of python libraries and usage of "for loops" to iterate through.  
You are welcome to change the questions around and make a game show about whatever you like! 

Discord bot integration is in the works, and aswell as a stand alone GUI build aswell.
